You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.

I am the League of Shadows.

I got another another job. Your.

Your anger gives you great power. But if you Iet it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.

Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad.

Now choice is yours: exile or death?

It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.

You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.

As Gotham's favored son you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

You're taller than you look in the tabIoids, Mr. Wayne.

And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.
